# Day 1: Trebuchet

Combine numbers found in strings, sum them

## Part 1

* For each line of input:
  - Take the first and last numeral from a string
  - Combine them to form a two-digit number
* Return the sum of each two digit number

### Edge case
* A line might only have one digit

## Part 2

Same as part 1, but also include numbers that are spelled out as words.

### Edge case
* Numerical words may be substrings of each other, e.g., twone, tenine
